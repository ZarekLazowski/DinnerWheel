# dinnerwheel

## About

dinnerwheel is a small program that will decide what you should make for dinner.

Using a lottery system, you can define what dinner ideas suit you and how many "tickets" each idea should recieve.
The more tickets a dinner gets, the more likely it is that the dinnerwheel will pick it.

I am indecisive and after another week of my wife and I not being able to decide what to make, I created this to decide for us.

## Parameters

 - -n, --number: An optional flag to define the number of dinners to pull. The default is 1.
 - -G, --gui   : Tells the program to display the results via a drawn wheel, instead of the terminal session (WIP).

## Requirements

python 3.5+
